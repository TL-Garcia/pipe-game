# Pipe Game 

##What is Pipe Game?
You might be familiar with the Windows 2000 game "Pipes". The Pipe Game is a clone of this game with a twist! 

In the original game the objective was to join a water source to a drain via a series of pipes. In this re-imagination of the game we will be aiding a mad scientist (a.k.a: "The Doc") to hook up his *Reanimator* machine and create life!

Much more exciting, right?

Although there is a catch. The Doc didn't properly test his **Reanimator** machine and if we don't complete the circuit before the lightning storm hits, everything will blow up!! (talk about a hard internship).

So will you be the assistant of the year and give live to **The Monster** or will you leave the lab in pieces?
